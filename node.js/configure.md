# Configure

Find out more about your credentials in the [Cloudinary Account](../cloudinary-account.md) page.  

### Using Cloudinary URL

The simplest way to provide credentials to Cloudinary is by using the Cloudinary URL which contains all 3 credentials:

1. API\_KEY
2. API\_SECRET
3. CLOUD\_NAME

You can also provide these credentials independently to the config function.  To see examples of all of these techniques look at how to configure with Repl.it.

* [export credentials to the command line  ](using-the-repl.it-code-sandbox/using-credentials-on-the-command-line.md) 
* [set up an .env file or provide key/value pairs to the Repl.it SECRET store ](using-the-repl.it-code-sandbox/using-credentials-in-secrets.md)
* [set up an external file that runs config to process your CLOUDINARY\_URL.  and require in the external file to your main script](using-the-repl.it-code-sandbox/using-external-config-files.md)
