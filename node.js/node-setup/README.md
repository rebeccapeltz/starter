# Setup

### Node.js and the Node Package Manager \(NPM\)

With [node installed](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) you will be able to use the node command line executable to run Node.js scripts.  You will also be able to use the NPM CLI to install Node.js packages.  

The code presented in this Startup Guide will be available in REPL.IT code sandboxes.  Before you start using the Node.js SDK to **Upload, Manage, Transform and Deliver,** you should look at Using the REPL.IT Code Sandbox to see how to add credentials and run the code.
