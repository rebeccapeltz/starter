# Upload

There are many options available to upload images, raw and video assets.  You'll find Sandboxes for both on this page.  The basic upload is very similar for this starter.  You supply a source for your media, which in this case will be a remote file.  You will need to also supply a `resource_type` if you are uploading a video or raw file.  The default `resource_type` is `image` and will include for comparison.
